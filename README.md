# scRNA seq analysis tumor infiltrating T cells
This folder contains the notebooks for the analysis of single cell RNAseq data derived from antigen specific T cells derived from a patient before and after TIL infusion and from the TIL product itself. This analysis is part of the paper "Traces of recent activation serve to identify T cell receptors with high protective capacity outside the tumor" by Purcarea, Jarosch et al.
