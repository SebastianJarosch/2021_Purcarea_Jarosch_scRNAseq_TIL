# scRNA seq analysis tumor infiltrating T cells
This folder contains the notebooks for the analysis of single cell RNAseq data derived from antigen specific T cells derived from two patients before and after TIL infusion and from the TIL product itself. The patients are derived from van den Berg et al Publication <i>Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy in metastatic melanoma: boosting of neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity and long-term follow-up</i> (https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-000848). This analysis is part of the paper "Traces of recent activation serve to identify T cell receptors with high protective capacity outside the tumor" by Purcarea, Jarosch et al.
